# calculator

A small calculator website made with React.js

Run `npm run start` to initialise it in development, or `npm run build` to get the production files.

## Purpose

This is one of my early, quick portfolio projects. I'm still keeping it around to see just how long I can maintain a project for after creating it on 4 April 2018. I'm updating this readme just after the 6th anniversary.
